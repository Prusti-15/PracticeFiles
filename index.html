    <br>
    <P>An International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) is a specialized area within a country that offers favorable regulations and tax incentives to attract international financial institutions and businesses. It provides a platform for a wide range of
        financial services, including banking, insurance, asset management, and securities trading, with a global focus. IFSCs operate in strategic time zones and promote cross-border transactions, making them vital hubs for international trade and investment.
        They contribute to economic growth by creating job opportunities and attracting foreign direct investment. IFSCs, like the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and the Singapore International Financial Centre (SIFC), play a significant
        role in fostering global financial transactions and positioning the host country as a financial hub.</P>
